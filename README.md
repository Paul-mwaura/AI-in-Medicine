**[AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicin?)**

I have completed this specialization from Coursera by deeplearning.ai. 
This specialization consists of 3 courses.1) AI for Medical Diagnosis, 2) AI for Medical Prognosis and 3) AI for Medical Treatment. 
I have learned many things ,such as: Diagnosing diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images,Predicting patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models,Estimating treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials , Automating the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing etc.
