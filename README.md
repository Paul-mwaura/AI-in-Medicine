**[AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicin?)**

I have completed this specialization from Coursera by deeplearning.ai. 
This specialization consists of 3 courses
1) AI for Medical Diagnosis
2) AI for Medical Prognosis
3) AI for Medical Treatment. 

I have learned many things ,such as: Diagnosing diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images,Predicting patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models,Estimating treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials, Automating the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing etc.
